# 🧠 JS Logic Training Project

Welcome to my personal **JavaScript Logic Training** project!  
This is a multi-stage journey where I challenge myself to solve logic problems and explore core programming concepts using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **pure JavaScript** – no frameworks, no libraries, no autocompletion, no AI code generation. Just raw coding, thinking, and learning.

## 📚 How It Works

Each folder in this repository represents a **stage of difficulty**:

- `level-1-basic`: Basic logic and syntax
- `level-2-arrays-objects`: Arrays, objects, and functions
- `level-3-recursion-algorithms`: Recursion and classical algorithms
- `level-4-data-structures`: Manual data structures (stack, queue, etc.)
- `level-5-interview-prep`: Advanced challenges and LeetCode-level problems

Inside each folder, you'll find:

- A `README.md` with a curated list of exercises
- My own solutions in `.js` files
- Optional HTML/CSS to visualize or test some answers

---

## 🧑‍💻 The Rules

- I solve each problem **by hand**, asking **ChatGPT** only to explain the challenge.
- No AI-generated code, no VS Code autocompletion, no Copilot.
- No external libraries or frameworks.
- Everything is done using **vanilla JavaScript**, with optional HTML/CSS for DOM manipulation or basic UI.
- Each section includes a set of challenges and sometimes extra exploration prompts.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen my problem-solving skills
- Solidify my JavaScript fundamentals
- Practice English and tech documentation
- Prepare for real coding interviews
- Eventually be ready for **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **system design challenges**

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an ongoing project. I’ll keep updating the repo with:

- New levels
- Better solutions
- Notes, learnings, and alternative approaches

Feel free to explore, suggest, or fork it for your own study path!
